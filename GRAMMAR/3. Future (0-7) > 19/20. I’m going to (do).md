# 20. I’m going to (do)
## RULES
I am going to do something = I have already decided to do it, I intend to do it:
- Are you going to eat anything? Not, I am not hungry. 
- What is she going to do with the money? She going to buy a new car.
- I'm just going to make a call phone.
- This food smells horrible. I am not going to eat it.

### I am doing and I am going to do
I am doing - We fixed and have plan about tomorrow.
I am going to do - I decided that I will make tomorrow, but I do or don't talk with other people about plans.

Compare:  
- I don’t know what I’m doing tomorrow. (= I don’t know my schedule or plans)  
- I don’t know what I’m going to do about the problem. (= I haven’t decided what to do)

Often the difference is small and either form is possible.

### Smth is going to happen ...
You can also say that ‘something is going to happen’ in the future.
