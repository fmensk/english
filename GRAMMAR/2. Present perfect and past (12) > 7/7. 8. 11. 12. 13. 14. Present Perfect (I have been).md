### BEEN AND GONE

**been (to) = visited**

## how long have you (been) ... ?
We are married. (Present simple)
How long have we been married? (not How long are we married? )
We have been married for 9 years.

I **am** in the library.
I **have been** in the library since 9 am.

Continuous is often use with HOW LONG, but some words use only SIMPLE.

Live and Work use SIMPLE and CONTINUOUS
- I have been living here for 2 years. / I have lived here for 2 years.
But if we use ALWAYS with LIVE = SIMPLE
- I have always lived in Minsk.

We say ‘**I haven’t** (done something) **since/for** ...’ ( present perfect simple):
- I haven't seen Mama since august 2020.

### FOR AND SINCE when ... ? and how long ... ?

**We use 'for' with a length of time.**
	She's worked here for ten years.
**We use 'since' with a point of time to describe when the period of time began.**
	They've lived here since 2001.

![[Pasted image 20220715165612.png]]

**Sometimes we use the sentence:**
- without for: I have been married ten years (for ten years - good too).
- with in (negative sentence): I haven't had a holiday in ten years. 
- without for with all ... = I've lived here all my life (not for all my life).

- I have been married since 2003.

WHEN - Past Simple
